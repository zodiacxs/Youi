## Potential risks of Demo Web Shop
|Risks|Reason|
|-|-|
|No requirement for password when user register an account|This means user can register account with simple password like '123456', which imposes great risk of account being stolen or hacked|
|User not aware of out of stock items|Out of stock items are not removed/hidden or have an 'out of stock' sign, user might be spending time on view the item but not reazling it cannot be purchased (even though the add to cart button is hidden, it is not user friendly enough)|
|WebSite is not secured|Not using https protocol means the website is more likely to be attacked|
|Currency is not displayed|User will not know the actual price of the items, currency should be displayed|
|Cookies is enabled by default|Personal sensitive information is stored by default, this gives identity thieves a chance to be evil|
|Hidden items|Found a hidden item http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/major-league-baseball-2k9, which is not listed under any category, this makes website maintenance difficult|
|No consideration for accessibility|Disabled people will have hard time exploring the website because it is not accessibility friendly|
